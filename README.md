### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software team lead at [Lumen5](https://lumen5.com/), a pretty cool startup from BC, Canada.

My current side projects are:

* [rust-text-experiments](https://github.com/antoineMoPa/rust-text-experiments/blob/main/docs/attention_predictor.md), where I'm learning llm fundamentals.



I'm always learning and coding something new! Look at my pinned projects if you are curious.
