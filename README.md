### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software team lead at [Lumen5](https://lumen5.com/), a pretty cool startup from BC, Canada.

My current side project is [prflow.dev](https://prflow.dev/), a tool to track metrics for software engineering teams. You can find it on github [here](https://github.com/antoineMoPa/prflow.dev).

I'm always learning and coding something new! Look at my pinned projects if you are curious.
